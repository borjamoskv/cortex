# CORTEX — Trust Infrastructure for Autonomous AI

> Cryptographic verification, audit trails, and EU AI Act compliance for AI agent memory.

## What is CORTEX?

CORTEX is a local-first trust engine that provides cryptographic verification, immutable audit trails, and regulatory compliance reports for AI agent decisions. It sits on top of any memory layer (Mem0, Zep, Letta, or custom) and proves that agent memories are tamper-proof and auditable.

## Core Architecture

- **Storage**: SQLite 3.42+ with sqlite-vec extension (384-dim embeddings)
- **Integrity**: SHA-256 hash-chained transaction ledger + Merkle tree checkpoints
- **Consensus**: Reputation-weighted multi-agent verification (RWC)
- **Search**: Hybrid semantic (vector) + full-text + Graph-RAG retrieval
- **API**: FastAPI REST + MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
- **Security**: AES-256-GCM vaults, multi-tenant isolation, rate limiting

## Key Endpoints

- POST /v1/facts — Store a fact with cryptographic ledger entry
- POST /v1/search — Semantic + Graph-RAG search
- POST /v1/ask — RAG synthesis (search → LLM → answer)
- GET /v1/status — Engine statistics
- POST /v1/missions/dispatch — Multi-agent consensus mission

## MCP Tools (CORTEX Trust Engine)

- cortex_verify_fact — Cryptographic verification certificate for a single fact
- cortex_compliance_report — Article 12 compliance snapshot with score
- cortex_decision_lineage — Trace decision chains for explainability
